# JournalProject
This is a summer project that I'm doing to warm up the coding part of my brain
and as a way refresh my Github knowledge.  I want to create a local journaling app
where I can store all of my logs securely and be able to organize important ideas
and goals that I have so that they are not lost among future logs.  Journaling 
is something that I want to do daily, so I want to enforce this with daily reminders
and measures that motivate me to journal in the morning.  Such a measure could be
locking website access.
